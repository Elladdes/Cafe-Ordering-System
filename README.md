Coffee Shop Project

This Coffee Shop Project is a simple and user-friendly application that simulates a small cafe's ordering system. The program features:

Welcome Page: A welcoming interface that introduces users to the coffee shop.
Drink Menu: A selection of beverages available for purchase, with options to customize your order.
Baked Goods Menu: A variety of baked goods and sandwiches to complement your drink.
Cart Option: An embedded cart within the menu allows you to view your current items at any given moment, making it easy to track your order.
Receipt Generation: After making selections, the program generates an itemized receipt, summarizing the total cost.
Tip Calculation: An option to add a tip as a percentage of the total bill, which is then added to the final amount.
This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts and user interface design.
It is an excellent example of how to create a simple yet functional application with a focus on usability and customer experience.
